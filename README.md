# Image Based Classification with Different Optimization Methods

## Objective
- Implement Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Decent and ADAM.
- Show graphs by iterations either train or test's loss and correct guesses.
- Learn how do optimaztion methods work with photos and compare them.

## Accomplished
- Method implementation created with C. (not used external lib)
- Graphs plotting with python for easy use.
- Created UI with Java Swing library.

## How can we use app
1. First you must find two separated class images and you must split into two folder. (tip: you can named it class_! and class_2. You can find example in "adrress")
2. Open app and click photos tab. (photos icon in left side)
- ![mainTab](/readMe/mainTab.png)
3. And you can select images by clicking folder icon.
- ![selectfolder](/readMe/selectFolder.png)
4. After you select your images you click Create icon right bottom corner.
5. You can go back main tab and tune your parameters and lastly you can run app by clicking Run button.
6. and you can see graphs our program plotted.

## Conclusion
- If spend time for tunning for methods can see stochastic gradient decent running random selected functions otherwise gradient decent working all function can be calculated. Adam running with momentum added fucntion terms.
- and if we can look tsne graph to compare we can see overally ADAM good thab other optimazion methods for convering.
